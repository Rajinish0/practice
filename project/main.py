this class gets the current state (screen) from the GameStateManager and updates and draws it every frame

	this gets the events from the display. If the mouse button was pressed
	then the event manager's mousePressed is set to true, this makes it easy to access
	if mouse was pressed through out the whole program (just query eventMgr's mousePressed property)

	If the current window requires more control of the event then it can implement its handleEvent method
	which is just empty by default. pollEvents calls this function every frame for the current state(window).
